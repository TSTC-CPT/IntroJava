            <div id="title">M1: Ascii Art</div>
            <p>
                Begin by creating a new Netbeans Ant project. Name the project
                with your own name followed by M1. For example:
            </p>
            <p>JohnDowM1</p>
            <p>
                Design a good ASCII Art program. It must be more than just a
                smiley face or block letters. You must use 2 different output
                statements from the Java language. Some examples I have seen in
                the past include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cartoon Characters</li>
                <li>Game Characters like Mario or Link</li>
                <li>Space ships</li>
                <li>Robots</li>
                <li>Animals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can access characters that aren't on the keyboard by using
                the ascii table. Visit
                <a
                    class="info"
                    href="https://www.lookuptables.com/text/extended-ascii-table"
                    target="_blank"
                    >asciitable.com<span>opens in new window</span></a
                >
                for a look at some of these extended characters. On windows you
                can type these characters by holding down the alt key, typing
                the decimal code on the number pad, and then releasing the alt
                key. If your keyboard does not have a number pad you can copy
                and paste the characters from the Character Map. To locate the
                character map, click Start and then type Character Map. Use at
                least one of these characters in your art. Use characters 179
                through 218 to print a frame around your art.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program must be your original ASCII art. <br />
                The code for the art must be at least 10 lines long, not
                including the frame <br />
                It must be something more than just block letters or a simple
                smiley face.<br />
                It must be created using 2 different output statements in Java.
                <br />
                It must create an image on the screen using only the characters
                from the ascii table.<br />
                You must submit zipped a
                <strong>Netbeans Ant</strong> project.<br />
                All programs must be written using <strong>JDK 17</strong>
                <br />
                Your name must be part of the project name and project folder.<br />
                No loose files or maven projects will be accepted.<br />
