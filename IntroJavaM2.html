            <p>
                This mastery assessment is designed to test your ability to
                write a Java program that is capable of getting input from the
                user, performing calculations, and displaying the results. It
                will also test your ability to properly declare and use
                variables in the program to store and use data. For this
                assessment you will create 2 programs. The first one will ask
                the user for data using a console window and will print the
                results to a console window. The second program will ask the
                user for the data using a JOptionPane and will also display the
                results to a single JOptionPane window. Please make sure the
                program displays 1 single JOptionPane window that introduces
                your business with the prices of your items per case and per
                individual. This same JOptionPane window should also ask them
                how many items they want. Then the the program should do all of
                the calculations, and display the entire receipt in 1 single
                JOptionPane window. You can print multiple lines to a single
                JOptionPane window. Do not use a separate JOptionPane windows
                for each line of the receipt.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have a small business that sells 1 type of product to local
                customers. You box the items in cases. Customers may purchase
                any number of items they wish, even if they are a partial case.
                You charge one price for each full case ordered, and another
                price for each individual item that is not part of a full case.
                The customer will enter the total number of items they wish to
                order. Your program will divide that number into cases and the
                number of individual items that are left over. For example: If
                your cases hold 20 items and the customer orders 48 items, they
                will be charged for 2 full cases and 8 individual items. Use the
                modulus operator to calculate the individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                You decide what your business is selling, how many items makes a
                case, the price for the case, and the price for individual
                items. Full cases should have a discounted price for each item
                in the case. For example if you sell individual items for $2.00
                each, and you sell them in cases of 10. Then the price per case
                should less than 10 individual items. At $2.00 each, 10 items
                would cost $20.00, so the price per case should be less than
                $20.00.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to state the name of your business, what your selling,
                the price for each individual item, how many make a case and the
                price per case in a welcome message. Be sure to format the
                prices in the welcome message to 2 decimal places and include a
                $ sign. Use variables to print the prices, do not physically
                type the numbers into the welcome message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your program will calculate the amount the customer owes for the
                cases and individuals items plus tax. Tax should be a
                calculation of a percentage of the amount owed. It is not a flat
                tax rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Declare all the variables at the top of the function, then use
                the variables in the rest of the code. Do not declare variables
                in the middle of your code. Do not type physical numbers into
                the output statements or calculations. Use the variables you
                declared at the top of the function.
            </p>
            <p>
                Format all output that represents currency to 2 decimal places
                and include a $ sign.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a receipt to display to the customer with a full
                explanation of the charges. For example, if my business sold
                crocheted hats for $5.00 each, or $25.00 for a case of 6, the
                receipt should look like this:
            </p>
            <p>
                Hollingshead's Handmade Hats<br />

                Total number of hats ordered: 15<br />

                2 cases of 6 hats @ $25.00 each = $50.00<br />

                3 individual hats @ $5.00 each = $15.00<br /><br />

                Subtotal: $65.00<br />

                Tax: $5.36<br />

                Total amount due: $70.36<br /><br />
