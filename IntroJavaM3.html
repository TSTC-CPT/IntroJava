            <p>
                For this mastery assessment you will create a program for a
                store that sells custom signs. The store will charge a flat rate
                for signs that have 1 image. If the customer wishes to use more
                than 1 image, you will charge an additional fee per extra image.
                Your program will ask the user for the message they want printed
                on their custom sign. If the message is longer than 10
                characters, you will charge them an additional fee per letter
                over 10. When the program begins ask the user what message they
                want printed on their sign, the quantity signs they want to
                order, and the number of images they want to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give your store a unique name. Be sure to print a welcome
                message along with information on how much you charge per sign,
                how much you charge per extra letter over 10, and how much your
                charge for extra images. The program will print out 3 messages.
                The first will be a receipt for the costs of one sign with one
                image, the charge for extra letters, the tax amount, and the
                total due. The second message will a receipt for the costs of
                multiple signs ordered with one image, the charge for extra
                letters, the tax amount, and the total due. The third message
                will be a receipt for the costs of multiple signs ordered with
                more than one image, the charge for extra letters, the tax
                charged, and the total amount due.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a class that includes private data members to hold the
                subtotals, tax charged and the total amount due. Additionally
                you may include any other data members you feel are necessary.
                It should also contain final constant members for the tax rate,
                the price for one sign with one image, the rate you charge per
                extra letter, and the rate you charge per extra image. The class
                should also contain three overloaded methods (methods that have
                the same name but different parameters) for printing the
                receipts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first overloaded method receives 1 parameter that represent
                the message to be printed on the sign. This method will
                calculate costs of the sign, the charge for extra letters, tax
                amount, and total due. It will then print a receipt that
                includes the name of your business, the message to be printed on
                the sign, The number of extra letters they have, the price per
                extra letter, the charge for the extra letters, the subtotal
                cost of the sign, the tax charged and the total amount due.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second overloaded method receives 2 parameters. They
                represent the message to be printed on the sign and the quantity
                of signs ordered. Calculate the costs of all the signs,
                including the charge for extra letters, the tax to be charged,
                and total amount due. It will then print a receipt that includes
                the name of your business, the message to be printed on the
                signs, the number of signs they ordered, the price per sign, the
                subtotal of the signs, the number of extra letters they have,
                the price per extra letter, the charge for extra letters, the
                subtotal costs of the signs plus the charge for extra letters,
                the tax amount, and the total amount due.
            </p>
