            <div id="title">M4: Quiz Creation</div>
            <p>
                Write a program that generates multiple-choice quiz questions
                over the Java programming language. The program will present the
                user with a total of 5 questions (one at a time) and 4
                multiple-choice answers for each question. The user will enter a
                letter (a-d) to answer each question. Store each response in a
                char variable. Each question will be worth 20 points. The
                program should also keep track of the score and display the
                result after all questions have been answered. Display the score
                as a percent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a class for your questions in a separate file. It should
                contain a String for the question and 4 additional Strings for
                the answers. The class should also contain a char variable to
                store the correct answer. Provide a default constructor and at
                least 1 overloaded constructor. Write a method to display the
                question along with the multiple choice answers in the console.
            </p>
            <p>
                In main() create 5 objects from your class using the overloaded
                constructor. Set the values for your questions and answers based
                on the content provided. Take all Scanner input using
                nextLine();
            </p>
            <h3>Content Provided</h3>

                    When several if/else statements are chained together, what
                    does the program do with the remaining if/else statements
                    when the first if statement is true?

                        <li>
                            Checks the final else statement and executes that
                            code

                        <li>
                            Checks the final else statement but does not execute
