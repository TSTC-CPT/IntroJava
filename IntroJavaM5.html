            <p>
                This program will simulate an epic battle between our hero, the
                player, and an evil monster from the dark world. The player will
                choose a weapon suitable for such an engagement and commence to
                proving his worth by vanquishing the fearsome foe. Hero and
                monster will take turns striking at one another until one of
                them is no longer able to stand. Our hero will have to choose
                which style of combat is most effective, based on his weapon and
                the standings of the battle as it unfolds. Only one can be
                victorious.
            </p>
            <p>
                Begin by creating a weapon class. Each weapon will have a name,
                base damage, critical hit chance, and critical hit damage.
                Provide constructors and a display() method for this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a game character class. This class will be used for
                creating the hero and the monster. Characters will need a name,
                weapon, and hit points, Provide constructors and a display()
                method for this class also.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main class will be used to host the game. Create member
                variables for the player and the monster. The program will be
                organized into the following member methods.
            </p>
            <h4>setup()</h4>
            <p>
                This method will setup the player and the monster for the fight.
                The player begins each battle with 100 hit points and the
                monster begins with 300 hit points. The monster is given a
                weapon with 50 damage and 0 crit chance. The player will select
                1 of 3 weapons from a menu. You can name the weapons whatever
                you want but the stats are to be as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="tableTitle">Weapon Stats</div>
            <table class="table2">
                <tr>
                    <th>Damage</th>
                    <th>Critical Chance</th>
                    <th>Critical Damage</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>105</td>
                    <td>75%</td>
                    <td>40%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>115</td>
                    <td>25%</td>
                    <td>50%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>85</td>
                    <td>20%</td>
                    <td>595%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br />
            <h4>namePlayer()</h4>
            <p>
                This method will be called only once at the beginning of the
                game. It simply prompts the player for their name and sets it
                accordingly.
            </p>
            <h4>play()</h4>
            <p>
                The play method will handle the main loop for the game. First
                show the health for both contenders. Then prompt the player for
                1 of these 3 options.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Attack</li>
                <li>Defend</li>
                <li>Retreat - ends the game in defeat</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Each option will call the corresponding method. The last thing
                to do here is check the hero’s hit points and call the endGame()
                method if their hp has fallen below 1.
            </p>

            <h4>calculateDamage()</h4>
            <p>                
                This method will receive a Weapon reference as a parameter. The
                damage dealt by each blow will be calculated 
                <a class= "info" href = " https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/random/RandomGenerator.html#nextInt(int,int)" target="_blank" >randomly<span>opens in new window</span></a> 
                based on the weapon’s damage value. The range will be from ½ weapon
                damage to full weapon damage. For example, if the weapons damage
                is 100, the lowest value will be 50, and the highest will be
                100. This method will also check for a critical hit. Roll a
                random float from 0 to 1. If the  <a class= "info" href = "https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#random()" target="_blank"> random float <span>opens in new window</span> </a>
                is less than or equal to the weapons crit chance, display a message informing
                the player of the critical hit. Calculate the additional damage
                to be added to the base damage and return the total damage.
            </p>
            <h4>attack()</h4>
            <p>
                Use the calculateDamage() method to return the amount of damage
                that will be dealt by the player. Provide the player with some
                creative dialog about how the attack has played out. Include the
                player’s name, the monster’s name, the weapon’s name, and the
                damage dealt in this dialog. Display health and damage as integers. 
                Reduce the monster’s health. If the
                monster is dead, call the endGame() method. If the monster is
                still alive, he will get to attack the hero. Call the
                calcuateDamage() method again for the monster’s attack. Provide
                dialog to the player explaining how much damage the hero takes
                and subtract the damage from the hero’s hit points.
            </p>
            <h4>defend()</h4>
            <p>
                Once again you will call the calculateDamage() method but the
                player’s attack must be reduced to only 40% of the returned
                value. Calculate the monster’s attack but then subtract a random
                amount from the damage returned, between the values of 10 and
                the value returned. Both the player and the enemy will take less
                damage when the player chooses to defend. Provide some dialog to
                narrate how the exchange of blows took place and update the
                character’s hp.
            </p>
            <h4>endGame()</h4>
            <p>
                This method will receive a boolean parameter to indicate if the
                game has ended in victory or defeat. Provide a corresponding
                message and ask the player if they would like to play again. If
                so, call the setup() method. Then return from endGame() to the
                main loop in the play() method.
            </p>
            <h4>main()</h4>
            <p>
                This is the code for main(). Change the main class instance to
                match your own. Any other changes to this code structure will
                fail the assignment.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                HeroVsMonsterBasic game = new HeroVsMonsterBasic();<br />
                game.setPlayerName(); <br />
                game.setup();<br />
                game.play();<br />
            </div>
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <p>
                When the program is complete, run the program several times.
                Test all of the weapons with different combat strategies. Write
                a short essay explaining your findings. Describe which strategy
                is most effective with each weapon and why. Include the essay as
                a comment at the bottom of the main file.
            </p>
