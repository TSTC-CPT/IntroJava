            <div id="title">M6: Account Creation</div>
            <p>
                Create a class called Account. Add 2 strings for an email
                address and password. Add the following member methods to the Account class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a method to validate the email address. The email should
                only have 1 @ symbol and should have at least 1 dot(.) after the
                @ symbol. There must be at least 2 characters before the @
                symbol, at least 2 after it and before the dot, and at least 2
                after the last dot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a method to validate the password. It must contain 1
                capital letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special
                character. The password must be at least 6 characters long.
                Special characters include those from the extended ascii table,
                such as ΩεαßΘΦ.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perform all validation using for loops and methods from Java’s
                Character class. Do not use any form of regex.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a method to set the name and password. Use do loops to
                prompt for the inputs. If the input fails the validation check,
                use the loop to reprompt for that input only.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a method that encrypts the password and returns the result
                as a string. The encryption must use at least 1 math operation,
                1 swap operation and include one additional distracter character
                in the result. Display the password in letter format and also
                numerical format after each operation. Create the returned
                string using a StringBuilder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a method that deciphers the password by reversing the
                operations in the encryption method. Return the result as a
                string. Create the returned string using the += operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                In main(), prompt the user for an email address and password.
                Call the encrypt and decipher methods. Store the encrypted and
                deciphered passwords in 2 new variables. Print the variables to
                the screen.
            </p>
