            <p>
                Write a program that simulates a small texted based adventure
                game. There will be a world to explore and items to collect. The
                player will move around the world collecting items. When all of
                the items are collected the player wins the game. The player
                will have limited energy and limited carrying capacity so the
                game will offer a bit of a challenge. This program will use all
                of the previously covered coding skills while incorporating some
                arrays and Arraylists.
            </p>
            <p>Begin by creating the following classes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Player
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Location</li>
                        <li>Inventory</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Location
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Description</li>
                        <li>Items</li>
                        <li>Adjacent Locations</li>
                        <li>display()</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Item
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Description</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    GameWorld
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player</li>
                        <li>Locations</li>
                        <li>Scanner</li>
                        <li>mainLoop()</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Player</h4>
            <p>
                Create the player class with a constructor. Set the starting
                location to null. Initialize the inventory as an array of 3
                Items, all set to null. If any element of the player’s inventory
                is not holding an item it should be set to null throughout the
                game.
            </p>
            <h4>Location</h4>
            <p>
                The location class will have a 2 argument constructor for
                setting the name and description. Each location will be capable
                of holding any number of items. It will also be capable of
                holding any number of adjacent locations. The display method
                will show the name and description of the location, along with a
                numbered list of items and a numbered list of locations. The
                player will be able to travel to any of the adjacent locations
                from the current location.
            </p>
            <h4>Item</h4>
            <p>
                Items are simply something for the player to collect. They can
                be picked up and dropped at any location by the player.
            </p>
            <h4>GameWorld</h4>
            <p>
                Most of the world will be setup in the constructor. The world
                will have an array of 6 or 7 locations. Use the map you created
                in the prep assignment. Each location will be instantiated in
                the GameWorld constructor. Provide each location with a name and
                an interesting description. Use adjectives. Create each location
                with the 2 argument constructor. Use final variables to help keep track of
                which location is which. Connect the paths between locations by
                adding them to each other’s arrayLists. For example:<br>
                final int FOREST = 0, BEARCAVE = 1;<br>
                
                if location[FOREST] is connected to location[BEARCAVE] you would
                write something like:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                location[FOREST].adjacentLocations.add(location[BEARCAVE]);
            </div>

            <p>
                Note this connection only goes one way, so you also have to add
                location[FOREST] to location[BEARCAVE] (Unless your player is
                traveling over a cliff).
            </p>
            <p>
                After linking all of the locations create at least 9 unique
                Items for your game. Add the items to the locations. One
                location must start with 3 items and 1 location must start with
                zero items. Distribute the others somewhat evenly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally set the player’s starting location. Provide some
                introductory text and the basic controls of your game, including
                how to drop items. Call the mainLoop() method. This concludes
                the constructor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mainLoop() method will display the current location and its
                description. It will also display the player’s current energy.
                Provide the player with a list of options to choose from. These
                options will be in a numbered list and include the adjacent
                locations and the items at that location. The numbers for the
                second list will pick up where the number of the first dropped
                off. These must update with each action as necessary. (See
                example output)
            </p>
            <p>
                Each time the player changes locations their energy will
                decrease by 1. If the player runs out of energy the game is
                over. If the player drops all of the items in any single
                location, the player wins.
            </p>
            <h4>Example output</h4>
            <pre>
Welcome to Adventure World!

Quiet Village
Several small houses are lined up on the outskirts of the village.
There are a few old shops around the town square.
Some children are playing in the street and the savory aroma of freshly baked bread is on the air.
A worn path leads out of the village towards a busy market. 

Items here:
1. Empty flask
2. Rusty horseshoe

Busy Market
There are several booths with vendors set up on both side of the path.
They call to all who pass by, offering their wares and services.
In one direction, the path leads out of the market to an open meadow.
In the other direction it winds into a quiet village.

Items here:
1. Milk crate
2. Crusty sandwich
