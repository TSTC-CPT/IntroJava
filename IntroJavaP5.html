            <div id="title">M5: Practice - Effective HP calculator</div>

            <p>
                Create a program to calculate the effective hit points of a
                Hero. Effective hit points represent the amount of damage a hero
                must take before he dies, including reductions from armor. Use a
                class named Hero with the following variables and methods:
            </p>
            <pre>
Private:
	Hero Name
	Base HP
	Strength
	Armor

	calcTotalHp()
Public:
	calcEffectiveHp()
        display()
    </pre
            >
            <p>
                The class should have one public method, calcEffectiveHP()
                (which calculates the effective hit points). The class should
                also have one private method, calcTotalHp(), which is called by
                calcEffectiveHP() to calculate and return the amount of total
                hit points the hero has. The display() method will show the
                labeled values of each member variable in a professional format.
            </p>
            <p>Use the following formulas:</p>
            <pre>
Total hit points = base hit points + (strength x 19)
Effective hit points = total hit points x (1 + armor x .06)   </pre
            >
            <p>
                Create an instance of the Hero class. Prompt the user for all of
                the object's information. Assign each value to the proper
                variable. Call the calcEffectiveHp() method and the display()
                method against the object. Take all user input with nextLine().
            </p>
            <p>
                Ask the user if they would like to enter another calculation.
                End your prompt with "(y/n)". If the user selects
                <strong>y</strong> reprompt for all of the data except the name.
                Any other response will end the program. Use an infinte loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validate the user's input using for loops. Iterate through each
                character in the input string and call the Character.isDigit()
                and Character.isLetter() methods to validate each entry. Wrap
                each prompt in a do loop so that it executes at least once. If
                the input is invalid, reprompt for that input only. Do not
                reprompt for data that was already entered correctly.
            </p>
            <h4>Validation Ranges</h4>
            <p>
                Armor should be between 0 and 50.<br />
                Base hit points should be between 300 and 1000.<br />
                Strength should be between 10 and 500.<br />
                Names should only be letters and spaces.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Submission Rules</h4>
            <p>
                Classes must be created in separate files.<br />
                All coding must be your own original work.<br />
                You must submit a zipped Netbeans Ant project. <br />
                Your name must be part of the project name and project
                folder.<br />
                No loose files or maven projects will be accepted.<br />
            </p>
